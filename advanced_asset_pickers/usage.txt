Using the attributes in your views and controllers is simple.
First you fetch the desired attribute value:
Example:

[code]
	$items = $page->getAttribute('testFiles');
[/code]

Now if the attribute is Users/Groups the object $items
has two methods 
	$items->getUsers();
	$items->getGroups();
they each return a array consisting of User and Group objects respectively.

If the attribute is Files it has one method
	$items->getFiles();
that returns an array of File objects.

If the attribute is Pages it has one method 
	$items->getPages();
that returns an array of Page objects.
